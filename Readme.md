# Groq API Integration for RAG Framework

This project is a FastAPI-based implementation that integrates Groq LLMs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The API allows users to send queries and receive responses from the Groq model while securely managing API keys via AWS Secrets Manager.

## Features

- FastAPI-based REST API for Groq LLM integration.
- Secure API key management using AWS Secrets Manager.
- Logging for monitoring errors and requests.
- Asynchronous API for efficient handling of requests.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install fastapi boto3 groq pydantic uvicorn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/groq_rag_api.git
   cd groq_rag_api
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up AWS Secrets Manager with the Groq API key:
   - Store your API key in AWS Secrets Manager under the secret name `groq_key` with the key `GROQ_API`.

## Usage

### Running the API

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

```sh
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### API Endpoints

#### Chat Completion

- **Endpoint:** `POST /chat`
- **Request Body:**

    "response": "I am an AI model. How can I assist you?"
  }
  ```
